# Challenge 01 - React Concepts

In this challenge I had to program functions in file src/components/TaskList.tsx.

The functions I've programmed were supposed to :
 - be able to add a new task to to do list.
 - be able to delete a selected task from to do list.
 - be able to sign a task as complete.
